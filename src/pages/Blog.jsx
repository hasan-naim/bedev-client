            #1 What is cors?
          </h1>
          <p class="text-xl text-[#b5c8d6]">
            For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests
            initiated from scripts. For example, XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch
            API follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web application
            using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the
            application was loaded from unless the response from other origins
            includes the right CORS headers.

            authentication?

            We use firebase for authentication purposes, we can also host our
            application in firebase, we can use the real-time databases in
            firebase, and many more. It is a server less service provider. We
            can use google, GitHub, and Facebook for authentication. Also we can
            use database for storing email and password.

            #3 How does the private route work?
          </h1>
          <p class="text-xl text-[#b5c8d6] mb-4">
            A website can have some public routes and also can have some privet
            routes. On the public route, anyone can visit by logging in or
            without logging but on a privet route(protected route) everyone
            cannot visit it. to visit a privet route user has to log in then
            he/she can visit the privet route(privet page). Privet routes are
            protected from a normal user. Only by logging a person can visit the
            privet routes.

            #4 What is Node? How does Node work?
          </h1>
          <p class="text-xl text-[#b5c8d6] mb-4">
            Node is a javascript runtime environment. Node allows developers to
            write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process
            itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to
            write server-side applications with access to the operating system,
            file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional
            applications. Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by,
            systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js
            takes the event model a bit further.
